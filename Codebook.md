A full description of data is available at the site where the data was obtained:

Process

The script run_analysis.R performs the following process to clean up the data and create tiny data sets:
1. Merges the training and the test sets to create one data set.
2. Extracts only the measurements on the mean and standard deviation for each measurement.
3. Uses descriptive activity names to name the activities in the data set
4. Appropriately labels the data set with descriptive variable names.
5. From the data set in step 4, creates a second, independent tidy data set with the average of each variable for each activity and each subject.The result is saved as tidyData2.txt.

Variables

testData - table contents of test/X_test.txt
trainData - table contents of train/X_train.txt
X - Measurement data. Combined data set of the two above variables
testSub - table contents of test/subject_test.txt
trainSub - table contents of test/subject_train.txt
S - Subjects. Combined data set of the two above variables
testLabel - table contents of test/y_test.txt
trainLabel - table contents of train/y_train.txt
Y - Data Labels. Combined data set of the two above variables.
featuresList - table contents of features.txt
features - Names of for data columns derived from featuresList
keepColumns - logical vector of which features to use in tidy data set
activities - table contents of activity_labels.txt. Human readable
tidyData - subsetted, human-readable data ready for output according to project description.
uS - unique subjects from S
nS - number of unique subjects
nA - number of activities
nC - number of columns in tidyData
td - second tiny data set with average of each variable for each activity and subject

Output

tidyData.txt

tidyData.txt is a data frame.

The first column contains subject IDs.
The second column contains activity names.
The last 66 columns are measurements.
Subject IDs are integers between 1 and 30.

tidyData2.txt

tidyData2.txt is a data frame.

The first column contains subject IDs.
The second column contains activity names.
The averages for each of the 66 attributes are in columns 3-68.
